                <br>
                The selection committee for the ACM/SIGAI Autonomous Agents Research Award is pleased to announce that
                Dr. Craig Boutilier, Principal Research Scientist at Google, is the recipient of the 2018 award. Over the
                years, Dr. Boutilier has made seminal contributions to research on decision-making under uncertainty, game
                theory, and computational social choice. He is a pioneer in applying decision-theoretic concepts in novel
                ways in a variety of domains including (single- and multi-agent) planning and reinforcement learning,
                preference elicitation, voting, matching, facility location, and recommender systems. His recent research
                continues to significantly influence the field of computational social choice through the novel computational
                and methodological tools he introduced and his focus on modeling realistic preferences. In addition to his
                reputation for outstanding research, Dr. Boutilier is also recognized as an exceptional teacher and mentor.
